## GitHub User Activity CLI

This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built with NestJS that fetches and displays user activity data from the GitHub API. The application allows users to input a GitHub username, retrieves the latest activities for that user, and displays them in a structured format in the terminal.
See other projects and ideas in [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity).

## Features
* Fetch GitHub Activity: Retrieves recent events such as repository watching, code pushes, and public activity for a specified GitHub user.
* Customizable Event Limit: Users can specify a maximum number of events to display, providing flexibility in the amount of data returned.
* Formatted Output: Each event is displayed with a clear timestamp, event type, and repository name to make the output easy to read.

## Error Handling: Gracefully handles various error scenarios
* Invalid usernames
* Exceeding the GitHub API rate limit
* Network and API errors with user-friendly messages

## Technical Details
* NestJS: A scalable and maintainable framework, ideal for structuring the CLI as a modular, testable application.
* TypeScript: Ensures type safety, improving code reliability and maintainability.
* date-fns: Formats event timestamps to make them human-readable.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## How to use
1. Run the Application: After compiling the project, run it from the terminal with:
```bash
node dist/main.js <username> <maxEvents>
```
Replace **username** with the GitHub username you want to check and **maxEvents** (optional) with the number of recent events to fetch.

2. Example:
```bash
npm run start:cli -- octocat 5
```

## Potential Future Enhancements
* Filter by Event Type: Allow users to specify event types theyâ€™re interested in (e.g., PushEvent).
* Save Output to File: Add an option to save activity logs to a file for later review.
* Extended Data: Retrieve additional details about each event, like commit messages or repository descriptions.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
